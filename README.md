# Cinester
Cinester, developed in Python, uses the Valence Aware Dictionary model for Sentiment Reasoning. VADER from the Natural Language ToolKit helps to classify reviews by summing up the intensity or the sentiment scores of each word in the text. It also uses TfidfVectorizer which provides a better accuracy than VADER.
